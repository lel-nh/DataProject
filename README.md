Data Project

Our data project consists of the creation of a deep learning model in order to identify species of a mushroom thank to a picture.

To try our code, (where the model we have is not accurate for the moment), download the 'Mushroom_Classification.ipynb' file open it on google drive/collad, then download the pictures of mushroom from kaggle with this link : 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maysee/mushrooms-classification-common-genuss-images/data

Then in google drive create a folder name 'Mushroom'. You can now run the program ! 

If you want more information about the creation of this project and what we learn from this project please refer to the 'mushroom project.pdf' to have further information
